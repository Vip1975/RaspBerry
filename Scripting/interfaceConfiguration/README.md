Auto autoUpdateScript

The reason for this script is to configure the eth0 interface using a static IP-Configuration Profile, if no information is beeng profited by the DHCP Server. This is especially useful if the DHCP Server is down for maintenance. In this case your system should be able to use the defined IP-Configuration and still be accessible. 

Please not that your system will not receive an APIPA configuration!  

Feel free to copy and edit this script for your own personal usage.
