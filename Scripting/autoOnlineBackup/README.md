My OnlineBackupScript
Since I have more then 20 Raspberry's, I looked for a method to backups my Raspberry's life, instead of backing all the SD-Cards one by one. I use three deferent scripts witch
1. Backup all ETC Scripts: autoOnlineBackup-ETC,
2. Backup all LogFiles: autoOnlineBackup-LOG,
3. Backup the complete SD-Card to an Image File: autoOnlineBackup-IMG. 

This is what I came up with. 

Feel free to copy and edit this script for your own personal usage.

Restore the IMG-Files
Until now I was not able to get the online-recovery-Process working, but using the Raspberry Imaging-Tool (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) this process can be done easily.
